                                    <h1>Travelling and Photography</h1>
                                    <p> One of my greatest passions is photography and travel. This is not only a venture that I pursue but one that I identify with very closely. For this reason I lead this list of accomplishments with my Bolivia Tour of 2018. On this trip I not only visited one of the most beautiful places in the world but began to find a passion within my photography. I traveled to the remote regions of the southern deserts of Bolivia to witness colored lagoons and unending salt deserts. I also attempted to climb one of the tallest peaks in Bolivia; an experience that would then define my obsession with mountains and climbing. I have a fever for challenges and never had I been so physically and mentally challenged. Climbing Huayna Potosi brought me humility and respect towards nature. This feeling is one that I am intimate and desire that any who knows me will understand this about me. </p>

This has allowed me to expand my knowledge within the field of music and go as far as to produce a few tunes.

                                    <p>As an engineer I pride myself in perfect synchronicity between design and functionality. Ideally, one should never be traded for the other for great products deliver both. One project I worked on was <strong>Orchard</strong>; an everyday home hydroponics system. This product was designed to serve any small household with sustainable amounts of greens and grains. I was in charge of the electrical system which included lighting and water/nutrient controls. My teammates focused on the design, chassis dynamics and most importantly; <strong>system functionality</strong>. This intense and multi-discipline project pushed me to teach myself all about electronics, lighting and cross-system integration. I printed circuit boards and wired dozens of prototypes until we delivered a functioning hydroponics product. Below are more pictures of this product.</p>

                                    <p>During my college career, I spent a lot of time helping and researching for the YeeLab at Georgia Tech. This experience was the first time I began to truly respect and obsess over programming. I was challenged with several tasks where I had to model and optimize system designs via MATLAB. Code efficiency and readability was key for there were deadlines and other research students involved.

                                    <p>Working at Cupertino Electric was a wonderful experience as it taught me the value of good teammates. The work I did there was arguably tedious and grueling yet the team I worked for made every inch of effort worthwhile as we all supported each other in all tasks. It made me realize that I would value good teammates and coworkers over the quality of work. Additionally, they enabled me to take advantage of my skills, so I developed a few of excel macros and attempted to create an "AI". To reduce repetitive tasks at the office, I created a handful of practices and programs that would eliminate human error and reduce task completion times. They were designed with a focus on usability and several design cycles had to be run due to continual feedback from coworkers. Some of these macros were then implemented into work processes due to their success in improving the work flow.

                                    Furthermore, I attempted to program an artificial intelligence that would automatically read P&ID maps to tally the amount of equipment types there were. This program was not implemented as I did not have the time or resources to decrease its run-time.<br/>This experience not only taught me the value of a good team but demonstrated to me my passion for programming and app development.</p>

The pomodoro clock is a timer that helps you work and take breaks at a sustainble rate. In order to challenge my <strong>javascript</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> skills, I thought I would take that idea and make it my own. This was all written in vanilla javascript and took a long time to fully develop. Nevertheless, there isn't much more to say except; check out the link below to interact with this nifty app!</p>

                                    <h1>DotaStars</h1>
                                    <p>The game Dota 2 has an enormous and successful competitive scene providing prize pools of upwards to 30 million dollars. This amazing industry does a great job sustaining itself within the already established community but seems to have difficulty in communicating to newcomers. Having all the match and tournament schedules centralized in one location would enable more viewers to commit to the year-round competitive scene. For this reason I began developing this <strong>DotaStars</strong> application which will eventually allow users to favorite and follow particular matches, tournaments, teams or even players. This would allow users to more easily commit to viewing and supporting the competitive scene.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The current state of this app is intended to demonstrate my comprehensive ability with Ruby on Rails. I implemented dynamic elements via javascript and implemented as many DRY practices as possible; almost every page uses a partial and there was significant effort put into simplifying the SCSS. A significant challenge was allowing the user to change the team roster all at once instead of having to edit each player individually. Further development will enable admins and users to manipulate information. Admins will be allowed to edit their teams while users will have the ability to favorite and follow events, matches and teams. Note; my visual graphics skills aren't up to par with my coding as my goal but I intend to eventually involve graphic designers in the project.
